# SDAS_Tester
Seismic Data Acquisition System Tester based on Microcontroller and FPGA


##		Seismic Data Acquisition System with Data Logger
Brief Description:	Seismometer signal is digitized and can be displayed graphically on computer or can be logged in SD card for 1 hour
Detail:	The purpose of the project is to build a low-cost seismic data acquisition system using 24-bit delta sigma modulator and decimated by implementing CIC filter, Inverse CIC filter and FIR filter in FPGA to get 50samples/sec. It also has a microcontroller-based data logger to log 1-hour seismic data in separate file. The GPS data is incorporated via serial port from M12 GPS receiver. The real time seismic data can also be displayed on computer using our own design software.
Key Hardware:	8051 Microcontroller, Spartan-III FPGA, Keypad, LCD, SD card, M12 GPS Receiver
